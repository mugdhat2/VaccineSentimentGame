File MinutesOfMeetings summarizes the Friday meetings along with future analysis and tasks for team members.\

File undirectedgraph.txt is extracted from the albemarle county network in /project/biocomplexity/nssac/EpiHiperSynPop/va_plus_alba_cville_1.7.1/va_albe_cville_contact_network_config_min_5_max_100_alpha_400_week.txt\
It represents the undirected graph with the weights as the total duration of contact (in seconds). Edges with less than 1hr of total contact are excluded.

The data file is replaced since the previous one had some errors. The new one is in process of getting the edges with weights as duration (could not upload due to the size).
