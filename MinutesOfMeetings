-- Create 2 git repos: one to be shared with Travis. code, Under nssac; Another with papers, etc. 
-- Different component characteristics upon SD and Vaxx.
-- Hypothesis: even with uniform costs some pattern emerge from the the network properties
-- Use Achla-Chen scenarios for disparities in outcome
-- rank different public health policies for compliance/efficacy vs effect

09/25
-- loop over best response and average over all NE's. (or the worst NE). Analyze the characteristics of equilibrium
-- Define worst? -- fewest vacc nodes
                 -- min social distancing
-- parallelize best response code 
-- cost of cutting edges difficult to calibrate-- depends on compliance and income range
-- cost of vacc (depends on insured or uninsured? cost of doc visits and tests? state/place of residence?)
-- cost of tests different when tested positive and negative
-- if symptoms or high exposure (outside home degree weighted by contact time) --> test 
      --> negative then no additional cost or benefit (no stigma-- benefit?)
      --> positive then early treatment and better compliance in social distancing with corresponding costs (increased treatment cost & reduced health cost & higher cost due to stigma; how to calibrate?)
      --> false positive? (skip for now)
-- is cost of stigma lower if you have smaller (non-household) degree? since low social capital: "Let's not consider stigma; not an issue in the US yet"
-- characteristics of nodes that get tested; then target intervention to other classes


09/18
-- Node characteristics important in social distancing? demography important; disparities in compliance; compliance increases with age
-- Cost of cutting an edge based on occupation? Test if it is by default reflected in network structure?
-- "Perceived" cost of sickness/treatment depends on income type: salary/wage
-- Household cost vs. individual cost- decision planes for differences in outcomes
-- Characteristics of clusters which remain unvaccinated upon vaxx decision equilibrium
-- Proposal writing R01- outline in a month; target Feb 2021? MT references dig for initial write up
-- WHO recommendations as scenarios for strategic behavior; Data collection; incorporating behavior surveys
-- FB survey; CMU; paid? BMC https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3703-2
-- community detection algorithms on Albemarle network: clustered community and trait distribution correlation? On weighted network, weights being the number of edges (contact time)

09/11
-- social distancing and fairness for Virginia networks
-- covid analysis epihiper
-- measles analysis epihiper (note no asymptomatic)
-- Measles NIH coordinate + GitHub + travis, kayzer? Anil will initiate email; Mugdha coordinates.
